This is our GitHub repository
- First you clone the github directory into your computer somewhere with: 
git clone "repository link"
- If you want the latest version to start editing you go to your github directory in your own system and type: 
git pull
- When you edited a file you perform these three commands:
git add -A
git commit -am "mention what you changed between these quotes so we see what you did"
git push
